# Python Repository

Welcome to my Python Learning Repository! This repository captures my Python learning journey, including daily code snippets and projects from an AI course.

## Daily Python Code

Explore my daily Python code snippets covering various topics and concepts. Each directory represents a day's worth of practice, showcasing my progress and exploration in Python programming.

- **Daily Code Practice:** From introductory Python concepts to more advanced topics, witness my growth in coding proficiency.

## Artificial Intelligence Course

As part of my Python learning journey, I've included practical implementations from an AI course. Here's a snapshot of what's covered:

- **Foundations of AI:** Exploring historical context, agent types, and rationality.
- **Search Strategies:** Implementing algorithms like BFS, UCS, DFS, and heuristic-based searches.
- **Local Search Techniques:** Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, and optimization strategies.
- **Machine Learning Basics:** Covering supervised learning and basic neural network concepts.

## Comprehensive Revision

I've conducted a comprehensive revision of the AI course material, ensuring a deep understanding of both Python and AI principles.

Feel free to explore the daily Python code, AI course projects, and my learning journey documented in this repository. If you have any feedback or questions, I'd love to hear from you!
