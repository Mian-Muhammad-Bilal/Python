# AI Course Repository

Welcome to my AI Course Repository! ðŸš€ This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my journey through the exciting and dynamic world of Artificial Intelligence.

## Course Overview

In this course, I delved into the fundamental concepts and applications of AI. Here's a glimpse of the topics covered:

- **Foundations of AI:** Explored the historical context, applications, and underlying principles of artificial intelligence.
- **Agent Types and Rationality:** Understanding intelligent agents and their decision-making processes (PEAS - Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors).
- **Problem Solving Agents:** Addressed different types of problems, including the classic Vacuum Cleaner World and the 8-puzzle.
- **Search Strategies:** Implemented various search algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- **Informed Search:** Explored heuristic-based search strategies, such as Greedy Best-First Search and A* algorithm.
- **Local Search Algorithms:** Covered techniques like Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms.

And much more, including logical agents, adversarial search, constraint satisfaction problems, and an introduction to machine learning with a focus on supervised learning and basic neural network concepts.

## Practice Code

This repository includes hands-on implementations of the theoretical concepts covered during the course. Some highlights:

- **Search Algorithms:** Practical code for BFS, UCS, DFS, and heuristic-based searches.
- **Local Search Implementations:** Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, and other optimization techniques.
- **Machine Learning Projects:** Implementations of supervised learning algorithms and basic neural network concepts.

## Comprehensive Revision

To solidify my understanding, I conducted a comprehensive revision of the entire course material, ensuring a deep and holistic comprehension of AI principles.
