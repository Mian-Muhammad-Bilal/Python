1. Design a PayRoll class that has data members for an employee’s hourly pay rate, and number of hours
worked. Write a main code with an array of n (take n from user input) PayRoll objects. The program
should ask the user for the number of hours each employee has worked and hourly pay rate and will then
display the amount of total pay each has earned. Do not accept values greater than 60 for the number of
hours worked. The data members must be private.

2. Write a Circle class that has radius, and pi (const value) = 3.14159 as data members The class should have
the following member functions:

Default Constructor. A default constructor that sets radius to 0.0.

Constructor. Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument.

setRadius. A mutator function for the radius variable.

getRadius. An accessor function for the radius variable.

getArea. Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as area = pi * radius * radius

getDiameter. Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as diameter = radius * 2

getCircumference. Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as circumference =2 * pi * radius

Write a program that demonstrates the Circle class by asking the user for the circle’s radius, creating a Circle object, and then reporting the circle’s area, diameter, and circumference.
